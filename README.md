# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

A dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript, with responsive user interface

## Acceptance Criteria

For week 6 of the eDX skills boot camp we were challenged with creating a website that has:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer. - done
    
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears - done
    
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock - I didnt manage to work out how to deduct time from the time :( - yet

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. - done

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score - kind of done. can get it to store as a li item, but need to work out how store the scores on the high scores page. I will come back to this, I have spent to much time on it and might fall behind on other challenges.

  THINGS LEFT TO DO:

  - I need to, make it so the timer stops when the game ends
  - make it so the buttons and input box to imput name dissapear after user clicks submit
  - to update local storage, on another page?
